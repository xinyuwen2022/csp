# csp

You are given a 5 x 5 grid, and this grid should hold the letters A through Y.  Some of the cells in the grid are already filled out.  The others can go anywhere, but the constraint is that adjacent letters (for example F and G) must be adjacent to each other, either horizontally or vertically.  

-    -    -    -    Y
R    A    -    -    -
-    -    -    -    -
-    E    -    -    -
-    -    -    -    K


The main function solve_csp uses a heuristic depth-first search strategy to find a valid assignment of letters to cells in the grid. The heuristic used is the most constrained variable heuristic, which is implemented in the find_most_constrained_position function. This heuristic chooses the variable (or cell, in this context) that has the most constraints on it to assign first. In this case, it chooses the cell that has the most neighboring cells already filled.

The solve_csp function recursively tries all possible letters in the most constrained cell. It uses the is_valid_move function to check if a letter can be placed in the cell according to the constraints. If a letter can be placed in the cell, it is added to the grid, removed from the available letters, and the function is recursively called to fill the remaining cells. If all cells can be filled this way, a solution is found.

If it turns out that no letter can be placed in a certain cell, the function backtracks. This means it undoes the assignment of the last letter, adds it back to the available letters, and tries the next letter. If all letters have been tried and none of them can be placed in the cell, the function returns False, indicating that no solution can be found with the current assignments.

This process continues until all cells are filled and a valid assignment is found, or all possibilities have been tried and no solution is found.
